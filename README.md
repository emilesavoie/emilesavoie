Welcome to my portfolio! Below is a selection of projects showcasing my hands-on experience in designing and developing robotic systems and applications. All of these projects are the result of great teamwork and collaboration, but the focus here is on my own contributions.

Enjoy!

## Rovus - Robotique UdeS

## La Machine - Jeux de génie
The machine competition's aim is to design a multidisciplinary robotic solution capable of overcoming various challenges on a predefined course, while respecting a precise grading rubric. This project spanned over 4 months where prototyping and integration are the main challenges. My role in the team was software lead and pilot.

### Personal Contributions
- Low-level (Teensy 4.1) interfacing of DRV8243Q1 motor drivers
- RF communication between the controller and the robots
- Development of control logic for over 50 actuators across all three robots
- Development of solenoid driver PCB from MCU GPIO pin

## Aetos - School project
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Aetos-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/Projet-S4-MDM/Aetos)

The goal of Aetos was to design a vision-enabled cable robot from scratch. One of the main objectives was to create an open-source project. This project spanned four months, during which I served as the software design lead.
